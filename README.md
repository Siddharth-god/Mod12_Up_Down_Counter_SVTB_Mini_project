# MOD-12 Up/Down Counter Verification (SystemVerilog)

This project implements a SystemVerilog testbench to verify a MOD-12 up/down counter.

## Key concepts learned
- Synchronization between driving and sampling
- Proper use of monitor and reference model
- Expected vs DUT output comparison
- Timing discipline in verification
- Debugging mismatches systematically

## Files
- udm12_svtb.sv : Complete testbench and DUT

## Tool used
- QuestaSim
- VS Code

## Status
Working version. Assertions will be added next.
